SQL to Mongo

database
schema => Database(db) 
collection of records 
table => collections 
singular record in collection of records 
row/record => document 

///basic database commands in mongo terminal 

show all databases 
//show dbs 

show current database 
//db 

make new/change to another database 
//use (db name goes here) 

delete database 
//use (db name goes here) 
//db.dropDatabase() 

///basic collection/table commands in mongo terminal
///after you have already selected your database 

view all collections 
//show collections 

create new collection 
//db.createCollection("collection name")

destroy collection 
//db.(collection name).drop() 

///basic document/row/record mongo terminal commands 

there aren't any as mongo is meant to be as flexible as possible.
all collections are JSON objects which can be modified on the fly
